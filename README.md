# WP Studio Manager

WP Studio Manager is a modular WordPress plugin for managing classes, instructors and clients across many industries. The project began as a gymnastics management tool but now targets a wide range of studios including fitness, education, creative workshops and wellness centers. The plugin provides an extensible architecture with a flexible industry configuration system.

## Project Goals
- Replace expensive SaaS solutions like iClassPro and MindBody with a WordPress based alternative.
- Offer a unified admin dashboard for participant, session and instructor management.
- Provide a client portal and booking system via shortcodes.
- Integrate with common payment gateways and marketing tools.

## File Structure
The plugin follows the directory structure described in `outline2.0.md` with separate folders for core classes, admin controllers, frontend shortcodes, integrations and more. Placeholder files have been created to scaffold upcoming development.

## Installation
